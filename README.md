***PLEASE NOTE:***

**I am not directly affiliated with Rocket Pool. I am someone who is interested in their protocol and likes to talk about what I think about their proposals. At the time of writing I have no voting power but I like to summarize and give my own opinion on proposals to help those who have votes but no time to research to get a better understanding of what is going on.**
