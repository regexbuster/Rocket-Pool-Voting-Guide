## Proposals
- MC Budget Update Proposal
	- **Forum Post:** https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/mc-budget-update-proposal/2319
	- **Github PR:** https://github.com/rocket-pool/RPIPs/pull/75
	- **Opened:** To Be Proposed
	- **Closed:** To Be Proposed
	- **Summary:** This proposal does three things. It create a one-time payment to IMC and GMC to compensate for the intended split of the oDAO inflation being incorrect, changes the split to be the correct values as voted when the oDAO inflation was given to the pDAO, and increase how much of the oDAO inflation is given to the IMC based on the pool [here](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/justification-for-moving-odao-inflation-to-the-imc/1939/12). 
- RPL Staking Rework Proposal
	- **Forum Post:** https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rpl-staking-rework-proposal/2090
	- **Valdorff's Thoughts:** https://github.com/Valdorff/rp-thoughts/tree/main/rpl_staking
	- **RPIP-30:** https://github.com/Valdorff/RPIPs/blob/rpl_staking_rework_finalizing/RPIPs/RPIP-30.md
	- **Opened:** To Be Proposed
	- **Closed:** To Be Proposed
	- **Summary:** The proposal's main goal is to incentive node operators' to create many minipools and to convert LEB16s to LEB8s to be more aligned with the protocol's goals. How the proposal plans to do this is by changing how the inflation rewards are distributed. From 10-15% RPL staked rewards follow a linear weight scale but then slowly decreases logarithmically after 15%, to incentivizes low RPL staking. The new weight scaling also negatively affects LEB16 users which would incentivize them to turn their LEB16s into two LEB8s. All of this is to help increase the rETH supply so that more people can stake with Rocket Pool.
- 2023-10 GMC Nomination
	- **Forum Post:** https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/2023-10-gmc-nomination-thread/2274/3
	- **Opened:** To Be Proposed
	- **Closed:** To Be Proposed
	- **Summary:** This proposal is the regularly scheduled election for new GMC members so that the pDAO has a hand in the contents of the centralized governing body, the GMC. Node Operators should really look into what everyone has to say in the forum and see who truly resonates with their positions the most.

## TLDR
- I believe that the MC Budget Update Proposal is really good and that it would help correct some of the errors that previously happened. It would also work to help support Rocket Pool's marketing arm so that we can spread to new areas of the crypto-sphere.
- Overall I really like the RPL Staking Rework Proposal as it encourages both diversity of NOs, by having nodes with less collateral be more profitable meaning smaller operators can get rewarded, and increases the rETH supply by encouraging changing LEB16s to LEB8s which have more room for ETH "donated" from the protocol.
- Currently we have 11 nominees to vote into the GMC. According to RPIP-26, we will end up voting 9 of them into the GMC. In my opinion, all the candidates are good for the GMC and I have no reservations to endorsing any of them. That being said, there are two candidates, drdoofus and dondochaka, who have made it clear that they are either wanting other quality candidates picked first or that they will be very busy in the upcoming year. Thus, by remove those two, I believe that the rest of the candidates (waqwaqattack, epineph, rplmaxi.eth, destroyaaa, ken, jcrtp, rocknet, feelingoodfeelingrt) should be voted into the GMC. 

## Proposal Analysis
### MC Budget Update Proposal
- In order to rectify a problem that was identified with the inflation rewards to the IMC and GMC the proposal create a new payment to both groups that helps to match the oDAO inflation rewards that were promised but not disbursed correctly. Also, we are looking to enhance the IMC's ability by increasing their share of the oDAO inflation rewards to 50%. This move is to help bolster the IMC's ability to promote the protocol, connect with other platforms and protocols, and facilitate collaborative efforts between Rocket Pool and those other groups. The IMC serves as the business development arm of Rocket Pool so providing them with more funding is key to establishing more connections and spreading Rocket Pool's services to more users.
- I personally really like this proposal and hope that it goes though since it would help the Rocket Pool protocol to spread to other systems and increase the amount of people that can work with and use the protocol.
### RPL Staking Rework Proposal
- The main objective of the proposal is to reallocate how the RPL rewards are spread between node operators (NOs). This is to incentivize NOs to align themselves more with Rocket Pool's goals of increasing rETH supply. The proposal attempts to increase the supply by incentivizing LEB8s and having many minipools with minimal amounts of RPL collateral. Using a slowly increasing logarithmic function after 15% RPL collateral you can make it unoptimal, or unprofitable sometimes, to have high collateral and LEB16s. Currently minipools with >30% make around 47% of the RPL rewards given to NOs. Instead, the proposal seeks to shift the rewards to give 56% of the rewards to NOs with 10-15% RPL, incentivizing many minipools for more rETH supply. NOs voting on this proposal should not that this does not change the rewards for any group other than the NOs.
- The RPIP for the proposal has a lot of the math for calculating the actual rewards but it bubbles down into a few simple ideas. The first idea is that there is a linear reward scale from 10%-15% and after 15% it keeps increasing but by a very small amount due to it's logarithmic curve. The second idea is that over the next 5 reward periods the old and new reward rules will merge together until on the 6 period the reward rules are fully reliant on the rules set forth in this proposal. The final idea is that there is a change to RPL withdrawing from a node. You can withdraw down to 15% RPL collateral and it must sit in a unstaking position for 28 days before you can fully withdraw it from the protocol. During it's stay as unstaking RPL it cannot be used for voting, rewards, minipool creation, etc. Overall this is a good change to both help smaller NOs, to help get more diversity in the protocol, and also in increasing the amount of rETH supply that we are able to have.
- Overall I really like these changes as it encourages both diversity of NOs, by having nodes with less collateral be more profitable, and increases the rETH supply by encouraging changing LEB16s to LEB8s which have more room for ETH "donated" from the protocol.
### 2023-10 GMC Nomination
- For the GMC nominees I have two possible biases. One with feelingoodfeelingrt and one with waqwaqattack that I'd like to acknowledge before I talk about all the nominees and my opinions. I have worked directly with feelingoodfeelingrt on the University Staking Program, and I anticipate working more with him in the near future. I also would like to acknowledge that I have been on waqwaqattack's podcast, Rocket Fuel, and I actively watch and enjoy his content. Beyond the one episode of the podcast, I have not directly worked with waqwaqattack and do not plan to in the near future. While I feel that I will be unbiased in my review of the nominees, I'd like to make my possible biases clear for people who are reading my content.
- lookingforowls' statement as a potential member of the GMC shows many qualities that are good in a member of the committee. They have been an active member of the RP community since the testnet phase and have run a node up until recently, showing their longstanding commitment to the protocol. As a primarily rETH holder now, lookingforowls is looking to represent an under-represented section of the community. In contrast to drdoofus' interest in funding quality ideas as long as there's funding, lookingforowls is more interested in finding projects that can prove their benefit before giving them funding. With a background in tech and crypto, they bring valuable experience to the GMC. While they are a well-known community member, most of their contributions are social and peripheral and they are excited to make a bigger contribution to the protocol by serving on the GMC. It is worth noting that they are planning to travel in November but after that they will have plenty of time to commit to their GMC duties. I think lookingforowls would be a good candidate for the GMC due to abilities and their ability for committing time to their duties.
- feelingoodfeelingrt will bring plenty of experience and a strong commitment to Rocket Pool to the GMC. Having been promoting Rocket Pool since 2022, he has also set up multiple nodes and has actively focus on helping onboard new ETH stakers and node operators. While they have ties to other LSD protocols, they commit to abstaining from votes that may present a conflict of interest. With a prolific online presence through blogs, X (Twitter), Web3 work, and Youtube, feelinggoodfeelinggreat demonstrates their dedication to the protocol and to teach new users how to get in. Their preference for subcommittees is marketing or research which aligns with their previous experience in the space. Overall, feelingoodfeelingrt's active involvement with the protocol and alignment with its mission makes them a strong candidate for the GMC.
- drdoofus involvement with Rocket Pool dates back to the beta testing phase in late 2020/ early 2021. They were initially drawn to the protocol due to their belief in the project's innovation and thoughtfulness. drdoofus is fully committed to supporting projects with funding where needed. They consider themselves a "yes" person that want to give funding to interesting projects if there's money in the bank. They have no conflicting affiliations but has a PhD in physics and does freelance programming giving them a valuable skill set to the GMC. They've been actively committed to Rocket Pool initiatives like SEWRPOO and Rocket Pool University. While they are happy to take the position, they want other quality candidates to be voted in first. Overall, I like drdoofus and think that he is a great nominee for the position. However, with their interests in mind we should prioritize other quality nominees.
- rocknet became an operator in January 2022, with prior activity in the testnet, reflecting their commitment to the protocol over time. They proudly support RP in public and is very invested in the Rocket Pool news by watch The Daily Gwei and Rocket Fuel. They are actively engaged in multiple LSD protocols via node operating showing an extensive understanding of the staking ecosystem. His background as a software developer and architect brings helpful technical expertise to the GMC. Their interactions within the community and with the core team at events like EthDenver demonstrate their commitment with connecting to the community and working to make the community a better place. Their contributions, including the creation of an Amazon Alexa skill and active involvement in supporting node operations, highlight their helpfulness and technical skills. They are not looking to replace certain members of the GMC but are purely running to provide options for voters to vote on. They would prefer the development subcommittee, which would make sense given their background. Overall, I believe rocknet demonstrates many helpful traits that voters should look for in a GMC member and they would be very beneficial to the development subcommittee. 
- jcrtp's dedication to making Ethereum validation more accessible, yet keeping it decentralized, is evident in their contributions to the Rocket Pool node operator experience. With a position on the core development team, they offer a helpful link between the GMC and the core dev team. This would help the GMC be more informed about grants and bounties that would be beneficial to the future development of the Rocket Pool protocol. Their current role as lead of the development subcommittee  as well as their position maintaining and developing the smartnode stack highlights their technical skills and active involvement within the protocol. Overall, their experience would make them an excellent choice to continue serving on the GMC to help lead the development subcommittee to know what needs to focused on in the future.
- Ken's role on the current GMC's research subcommittee as well as the influence they've leveraged for the protocol shows their dedication and experience in the Rocket Pool community. They've been actively working on the grant applications process and creating a process for managing and reviewing them. Ken declares no conflicts that would compromise a GMC position but does not that they've contributed to other staking services such as NodeSet and Diva. His contributions, which include co-hosting RP community calls, mentoring members, and introducing security-enhancing procedures for node operators, highlights their value as a GMC member. Overall, Ken's experience and dedication the protocol makes them an amazing candidate for the GMC.
- destroyaaa has extensive involvement within the Ethereum and Rocket Pool communities which reflects their dedication to both. They have no conflicts that would compromise their position on the GMC. Their job is as a software engineer and so their technical background would be helpful for the GMC's development subcommittee. Although they are mainly an enthusiastic community member, they have participated in beta testing, volunteered at EthDenver, and have assisted others in becoming node operators, all of which demonstrates their commitment to the health of the protocol. Their preference for the development subcommittee is supported by their background in software development and would be able to provide valuable technical skills to the GMC. Overall, I think that destroyaa's alignment with RP's mission is strong, as is their commitment to the community, and their technical skills ice the cake of them being a wonderful GMC member.
- dondochaka's commitment to Rocket Pool is evident. Around 10% of their net worth is represented in RPL and coupled with their minipools they are very invested in the protocol. They are one of the Financial Stewards for the EVMavericks DAO, which shows their understanding of governance structures and how to work in one. As a software engineer with a history of leading teams, they bring leadership and technical support to the GMC. Their dedication to educating the Ethereum community about RP, their initiation of the Bankless advertising proposal, and promotion of RP within the EVMaveriks community all reflect the awesome work he's doing for the protocol. However, dondochaka mentions that they have a busy schedule in the coming year but if elected will commit to the GMC to the best of their ability.
- rplmaxi.eth's dedication to Rocket Pool really started with the node they started in March 2022. Having served on the previous GMC for the past four months, they've been actively contributing to the recent process changes. Their background is in marketing and communications for the financial sector, a very helpful skill set for a GMC member. They also have the experience of speaking, reading, and writing in 4-5 languages which may help Rocket Pool reach into other sectors of the non-english speaking world. Their participation within the GMC channels and the designing of charity POAPs shows how committed they are to the protocol and the time they would spent to improve it. Their preference is for the marketing subcommittee, which given their background is a very good idea. Overall, I think rplmaxi.eth would make a wonderful GMC member for the marketing subcommittee.
- epineph's core values of democracy, equity, and decentralization is very in line with the Rocket Pool protocol's mission. Their focus on building better governance structures is helping to mitigate a weak part of the protocol. They are a healthcare worker with a hobbyist background in node operation and non-governmental organizations, which would bring a unique perspective to the GMC. Their contributions include running minipools since fay one of phase 4 and being active in the forum and general community. While their radical ideas push against the majority, their alternative ideas can help to poke at loose ends and provide alternate solutions to proposals, grants, and bounties that the committee would oversee. They have a strong sense of purpose, dedication to the decentralization of staking, and a commitment to strengthening governance. Thus, I believe they are a good member to be voted into the GMC.
- waqwaqattack has a very active presence in the Rocket Pool community which is evident through the insane amount of time he spends in community hubs and the the time he spends creating a daily podcast about the news of Rocket Pool. As the host of Rocket Fuel, he plays the important role of keeping the greater Rocket Pool community up to date with all the information they would struggle to seek out. His dedication to Rocket Pool is unquestionable. The majority of his holdings are in RPL and ETH, but he has recently relieved some Diva Staking tokens and has been delegated some votes. He is known for his active involvement within the GMC, consistent participation in pDAO votes, and his diligent efforts to spread Rocket Pool news. Overall, waqwaqattack's contributions to the GMC will likely continue to be beneficial to the protocol, making him a wonderful possible addition to the GMC.
- Currently we have 11 nominees to vote into the GMC. According to RPIP-26, we will end up voting 9 of them into the GMC. In my opinion, all the candidates are good for the GMC and I have no reservations to endorsing any of them. That being said, there are two candidates, drdoofus and dondochaka, who have made it clear that they are either wanting other quality candidates picked first or that they will be very busy in the upcoming year. Thus, by remove those two, I believe that the rest of the candidates (waqwaqattack, epineph, rplmaxi.eth, destroyaaa, ken, jcrtp, rocknet, feelingoodfeelingrt) should be voted into the GMC. 

## Proposal Unorganized Analysis
### Unorganized MC Budget Update Proposal
- There's really not much to add here. We're just getting back on track and sending out a payment to the GMC and IMC to compensate them for the missing oDAO inflation that they were guaranteed but not payed out.
- This proposal also plans to increase the IMC's share of the oDAO inflation rewards to 50%
	- It's good to increase the IMC's share of the inflation so that they can continue to work on spreading the influence of the protocol and connecting with other protocols so we can work together
	- IMC is basically the business building arm of RP so to increase people's awareness and ease of access to RP we need the IMC to be strong and well funded
### Unorganized RPL Staking Rework Proposal
- The goal of the proposal is to increase the spending of RPL rewards towards efforts that increase rETH supply
	- Some of the ways we change spending to incentivize greater rETH supply is to pay more rewards to LEB8s and to pay a logarithmically increasing amount of rewards past 15% RPL collateral staked 
- Roughly 70% of all RPL inflation rewards are payed out to node operators (NOs)
	- 23.5% to minipools with 10-15% collateral
	- 13.8% to minipools with 15-30% collateral
	- 32.7% to minipools with >30% collateral
- With the proposed changes the new percentages would become
	- 56.0% to minipools with 10-15% collateral
	- 10.1% to minipools with 15-30% collateral
	- 3.9% to minipools with >30% collateral
- This proposal does not seek to change the percentages of inflation rewards sent to any other group
- This proposal has a few variables it calculates to find the share of the rewards each minipool recieves
	- `proposed_method_share` is...
		- for one node, `node_weight` divided by the `node_weight` of all other nodes
		- if the staked RPL value in ETH is <10% borrowed ETH
			- `node_weight` = 0
		- RPL value in ETH is >=10% and <=15% borrowed ETH
			- `node_weight = 100 * staked_rpl_value_in_eth`
		- RPL value in ETH is > 15% borrowed ETH
			- `node_weight = (13.6137 + 2 * ln(100 * (staked_rpl_value_in_eth / borrowed_eth) - 13)) * borrowed_eth`
	- `current_method_share` is the share that a NO receives using the current rewards specification
	- "Staked" RPL is RPL that is locked in the protocol for active use (vote weight, minipool creation, rewards, etc.)
	- "Unstaking" RPL is RPL that is locked in the protocol but not counted for active use
	- "Unstaked" RPL is RPL that is not within the protocol or is in the protocol but not able to be withdrawn
		- previous RPL rewards or unstaking RPL that has been fully unstaked
	- X=1 is the first reward snapshot post the end of the vote and the implementation of the new rewards rules
		- X=2 is the snapshot after that and so on
	- these values are straight from the proposal's defining [RPIP](https://github.com/Valdorff/RPIPs/blob/rpl_staking_rework_finalizing/RPIPs/RPIP-30.md)
- Rewards periods X>5 shall fully use the new rewards rules
	- between X=1 and X=5 a node's share of rewards is
		- `(X/6) * proposed_method_share + ((6-X)/6) * current_method_share`
		- for these periods shares are calculated by a portion of both rules as we transition
- During the next smart contract upgrade the unstaking method shall be updated to a new 2-step process
	- anything over 15% RPL staked can be withdrawn into the Unstaking position
		- Unstaking RPL needs to stay there for the `unstaking_period` which is a pDAO controlled value started at 28 days
	- you can only have one portion of RPL unstaking at one time. you have to wait the `unstaking_period` and withdraw that RPL before putting more into the unstaking process
- voting power calculations are not changed base on the proposal's RPIP (but Unstaking RPL does not count for voting)
- if you're still reading about how this works I'd recommend just reading the [RPIP](https://github.com/Valdorff/RPIPs/blob/rpl_staking_rework_finalizing/RPIPs/RPIP-30.md) because it explains a lot better
