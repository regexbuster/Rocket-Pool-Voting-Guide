***PLEASE NOTE:***

**WHILE THE FILE INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE 2023-10 GMC NOMINATIONS AT THE BEGINNING, THE ACTUAL ANALYSIS IS NOT YET ATTACHED. THERE IS CURRENTLY A MISSING STATEMENT FROM A NOMINEE AND I'D LIKE TO WAIT TO SHOWCASE WHO I THINK SHOULD BE ON THE GMC UNTIL THEY POST THEIR STATEMENT. HOWEVER, I WILL POST MY ANALYSIS BY END OF DAY 10/13/2023 EVEN IF THE NOMINEE DOES NOT POST A STATEMENT.**

## Proposals
- MC Budget Update Proposal
	- **Forum Post:** https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/mc-budget-update-proposal/2319
	- **Github PR:** https://github.com/rocket-pool/RPIPs/pull/75
	- **Opened:** To Be Proposed
	- **Closed:** To Be Proposed
	- **Summary:** This proposal does three things. It create a one-time payment to IMC and GMC to compensate for the intended split of the oDAO inflation being incorrect, changes the split to be the correct values as voted when the oDAO inflation was given to the pDAO, and increase how much of the oDAO inflation is given to the IMC based on the pool [here](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/justification-for-moving-odao-inflation-to-the-imc/1939/12).

	- **Opened:** To Be Proposed
	- **Closed:** To Be Proposed
	- **Summary:** The proposal's main goal is to incentive node operators' to create many minipools and to convert LEB16s to LEB8s to be more aligned with the protocol's goals. How the proposal plans to do this is by changing how the inflation rewards are distributed. From 10-15% RPL staked rewards follow a linear weight scale but then slowly decreases logarithmically after 15%, to incentivizes low RPL staking. The new weight scaling also negatively affects LEB16 users which would incentivize them to turn their LEB16s into two LEB8s. All of this is to help increase the rETH supply so that more people can stake with Rocket Pool.
- 2023-10 GMC Nomination
	- **Forum Post:** https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/2023-10-gmc-nomination-thread/2274/3
	- **Opened:** To Be Proposed
	- **Closed:** To Be Proposed
	- **Summary:** This proposal is the regularly scheduled election for new GMC members so that the pDAO has a hand in the contents of the centralized governing body, the GMC. Node Operators should really look into what everyone has to say in the forum and see who truly resonates with their positions the most.

## TLDR

## Proposal Analysis
### MC Budget Update Proposal
- In order to rectify a problem that was identified with the inflation rewards to the IMC and GMC the proposal create a new payment to both groups that helps to match the oDAO inflation rewards that were promised but not disbursed correctly. Also, we are looking to enhance the IMC's ability by increasing their share of the oDAO inflation rewards to 50%. This move is to help bolster the IMC's ability to promote the protocol, connect with other platforms and protocols, and facilitate collaborative efforts between Rocket Pool and those other groups. The IMC serves as the business development arm of Rocket Pool so providing them with more funding is key to establishing more connections and spreading Rocket Pool's services to more users.
- I personally really like this proposal and hope that it goes though since it would help the Rocket Pool protocol to spread to other systems and increase the amount of people that can work with and use the protocol.
### RPL Staking Rework Proposal
- The main objective of the proposal is to reallocate how the RPL rewards are spread between node operators (NOs). This is to incentivize NOs to align themselves more with Rocket Pool's goals of increasing rETH supply. The proposal attempts to increase the supply by incentivizing LEB8s and having many minipools with minimal amounts of RPL collateral. Using a slowly increasing logarithmic function after 15% RPL collateral you can make it unoptimal, or unprofitable sometimes, to have high collateral and LEB16s. Currently minipools with >30% make around 47% of the RPL rewards given to NOs. Instead, the proposal seeks to shift the rewards to give 56% of the rewards to NOs with 10-15% RPL, incentivizing many minipools for more rETH supply. NOs voting on this proposal should not that this does not change the rewards for any group other than the NOs.
- The RPIP for the proposal has a lot of the math for calculating the actual rewards but it bubbles down into a few simple ideas. The first idea is that there is a linear reward scale from 10%-15% and after 15% it keeps increasing but by a very small amount due to it's logarithmic curve. The second idea is that over the next 5 reward periods the old and new reward rules will merge together until on the 6 period the reward rules are fully reliant on the rules set forth in this proposal. The final idea is that there is a change to RPL withdrawing from a node. You can withdraw down to 15% RPL collateral and it must sit in a unstaking position for 28 days before you can fully withdraw it from the protocol. During it's stay as unstaking RPL it cannot be used for voting, rewards, minipool creation, etc. Overall this is a good change to both help smaller NOs, to help get more diversity in the protocol, and also in increasing the amount of rETH supply that we are able to have.
- Overall I really like these changes as it encourages both diversity of NOs, by having nodes with less collateral be more profitable, and increases the rETH supply by encouraging changing LEB16s to LEB8s which have more room for ETH "donated" from the protocol.

## Proposal Unorganized Analysis
### Unorganized MC Budget Update Proposal
- There's really not much to add here. We're just getting back on track and sending out a payment to the GMC and IMC to compensate them for the missing oDAO inflation that they were guaranteed but not payed out.
- This proposal also plans to increase the IMC's share of the oDAO inflation rewards to 50%
	- It's good to increase the IMC's share of the inflation so that they can continue to work on spreading the influence of the protocol and connecting with other protocols so we can work together
	- IMC is basically the business building arm of RP so to increase people's awareness and ease of access to RP we need the IMC to be strong and well funded
### Unorganized RPL Staking Rework Proposal
- The goal of the proposal is to increase the spending of RPL rewards towards efforts that increase rETH supply
	- Some of the ways we change spending to incentivize greater rETH supply is to pay more rewards to LEB8s and to pay a logarithmically increasing amount of rewards past 15% RPL collateral staked 
- Roughly 70% of all RPL inflation rewards are payed out to node operators (NOs)
	- 23.5% to minipools with 10-15% collateral
	- 13.8% to minipools with 15-30% collateral
	- 32.7% to minipools with >30% collateral
- With the proposed changes the new percentages would become
	- 56.0% to minipools with 10-15% collateral
	- 10.1% to minipools with 15-30% collateral
	- 3.9% to minipools with >30% collateral
- This proposal does not seek to change the percentages of inflation rewards sent to any other group
- This proposal has a few variables it calculates to find the share of the rewards each minipool recieves
	- `proposed_method_share` is...
		- for one node, `node_weight` divided by the `node_weight` of all other nodes
		- if the staked RPL value in ETH is <10% borrowed ETH
			- `node_weight` = 0
		- RPL value in ETH is >=10% and <=15% borrowed ETH
			- `node_weight = 100 * staked_rpl_value_in_eth`
		- RPL value in ETH is > 15% borrowed ETH
			- `node_weight = (13.6137 + 2 * ln(100 * (staked_rpl_value_in_eth / borrowed_eth) - 13)) * borrowed_eth`
	- `current_method_share` is the share that a NO receives using the current rewards specification
	- "Staked" RPL is RPL that is locked in the protocol for active use (vote weight, minipool creation, rewards, etc.)
	- "Unstaking" RPL is RPL that is locked in the protocol but not counted for active use
	- "Unstaked" RPL is RPL that is not within the protocol or is in the protocol but not able to be withdrawn
		- previous RPL rewards or unstaking RPL that has been fully unstaked
	- X=1 is the first reward snapshot post the end of the vote and the implementation of the new rewards rules
		- X=2 is the snapshot after that and so on
	- these values are straight from the proposal's defining [RPIP](https://github.com/Valdorff/RPIPs/blob/rpl_staking_rework_finalizing/RPIPs/RPIP-30.md)
- Rewards periods X>5 shall fully use the new rewards rules
	- between X=1 and X=5 a node's share of rewards is
		- `(X/6) * proposed_method_share + ((6-X)/6) * current_method_share`
		- for these periods shares are calculated by a portion of both rules as we transition
- During the next smart contract upgrade the unstaking method shall be updated to a new 2-step process
	- anything over 15% RPL staked can be withdrawn into the Unstaking position
		- Unstaking RPL needs to stay there for the `unstaking_period` which is a pDAO controlled value started at 28 days
	- you can only have one portion of RPL unstaking at one time. you have to wait the `unstaking_period` and withdraw that RPL before putting more into the unstaking process
- voting power calculations are not changed base on the proposal's RPIP (but Unstaking RPL does not count for voting)
- if you're still reading about how this works I'd recommend just reading the [RPIP](https://github.com/Valdorff/RPIPs/blob/rpl_staking_rework_finalizing/RPIPs/RPIP-30.md) because it explains a lot better
